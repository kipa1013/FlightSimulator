## Input System

This package has a dependency on [Input System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.4/manual/index.html). If that package has not already been installed, Unity will automatically add it to your Project. You might see a prompt asking you to enable input backends. Click **Yes** to accept it. For more information, see [Enabling the new input backends](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.4/manual/Installation.html#enabling-the-new-input-backends) in the Input System package documentation.
